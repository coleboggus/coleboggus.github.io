    As a Software Engineer, I have experience with a wide range of JavaScript frameworks and
    libraries, including React, React Native, Angular, Svelte, and SvelteKit. I am skilled in
    creating responsive and interactive user interfaces that provide seamless user experiences
    across all devices and platforms.

    One of my primary areas of expertise is in building back-end applications using Node.js,
    Express, and NestJS. I have experience designing and developing RESTful APIs, creating
    serverless architectures, and integrating with various databases such as MongoDB and
    PostgreSQL.

    As a Cloud Engineer, I have experience with a variety of AWS services such as ECS, API
    Gateway, Lambda, CloudFront, S3, Code*, Glue, SageMaker, and many more. I specialize in
    designing and implementing cloud-based solutions that are scalable, cost-effective, and
    secure. I am skilled in using infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform and
    CloudFormation to automate the deployment and management of AWS resources.

<p>
    My experience in Cloud Engineering has helped me to understand the importance of scalability,
    performance, and security when it comes to cloud-based applications. Whether you need help
    with a new project or want to optimize your existing cloud infrastructure, I can help you
    achieve your goals and take your cloud-based applications to the next level.
